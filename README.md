# SWARM

Use 'n' to get into the next game mode
Use 'b' to get into the former game mode

Game modes are:
starting screen - play the game - credits

Within the game mode 'play the game' use '2' to get into the next level, use '1' to get into the former level.

If you have a kinect and the SimpleOpenNi library, you can switch the boolean useKinect in the class lowi to true.
The game will automatically detect the user and switch from game mode 'starting screen' to 'play the game'.

Mousecontrole

Use 'd' and 'e' to control the depth of the boids.
If you are using mousecontrole you can not perform the gestures (speedUp, divide, explosion).

If you like to, you can check out the promo video 'SWARM_PROMO.mov'. There you can see the program working when using a kinect.
